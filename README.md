-----------------------------------------------------------------Aggregation Function----------------------------------------------------------------------
What Are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single result (one value).

üëâ For example:
If you have 100 students‚Äô marks, and you want to know average marks, you‚Äôll use the aggregate function AVG().

üîπ List of Common Aggregate Functions
Function	Description	Example
COUNT()	Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values	COUNT(student_id)
SUM()	Adds up all the values in a column	SUM(marks)
AVG()	Calculates the average of numeric values	AVG(marks)
MIN()	Finds the smallest (minimum) value	MIN(marks)
MAX()	Finds the largest (maximum) value	MAX(marks)
üß† Important Points

Aggregate functions ignore NULL values (except COUNT(*) which counts all rows).
They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to group data.
They return one value per group or one total value for the entire table.

üìò Example Table: students
student_id	name	marks	subject
1	Anil	78	Math
2	Bhumika	93	Science
3	Chetan	85	Math
4	Dhruv	96	Science
5	Farah	82	Math
üî∏ 1. COUNT() ‚Äî Count Rows

Purpose: To count total number of records.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;

üëâ Output:
total_students
---------------
5

Count only specific column values (non-null):
SELECT COUNT(marks) FROM students;
üî∏ 2. SUM() ‚Äî Add Values
Purpose: To find total sum of numeric column.

SELECT SUM(marks) AS total_marks
FROM students;


üëâ Output:

total_marks
------------
434

üî∏ 3. AVG() ‚Äî Find Average
Purpose: To find the average marks.
SELECT AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students;

üëâ Output:
average_marks
--------------
86.8

üî∏ 4. MIN() ‚Äî Find Minimum
Purpose: To find the lowest marks.
SELECT MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks
FROM students;

üëâ Output:
lowest_marks
--------------
78

üî∏ 5. MAX() ‚Äî Find Maximum
Purpose: To find the highest marks.
SELECT MAX(marks) AS highest_marks
FROM students;

üëâ Output:
highest_marks
---------------
96

üî∏ 6. GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
If you want to apply functions for each subject:
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY subject;


üëâ Output:
subject   | avg_marks
-----------|------------
Math       | 81.66
Science    | 94.5

üî∏ 7. Using HAVING with Aggregate Functions
You cannot use WHERE with aggregate results ‚Äî use HAVING instead.

Example:
Show only subjects where average marks > 85:
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY subject
HAVING AVG(marks) > 85;

üëâ Output:
subject  | avg_marks
----------|------------
Science  | 94.5

üß© Summary Table
Function	Meaning	Example
COUNT()	Number of rows	COUNT(*)
SUM()	Total of values	SUM(marks)
AVG()	Average value	AVG(marks)
MIN()	Minimum value	MIN(marks)
MAX()	Maximum value	MAX(marks)

------------------------------------------------------------- View-------------------------------------------------------------------

üß© What Is a View in SQL?

A VIEW is a virtual table that is based on the result of an SQL query.
It looks and acts like a table but does not store data physically ‚Äî it stores only the SQL query.
You can select, join, and filter data from one or more tables and save that query as a view.

üí° Think of it like this:
A view is a saved SELECT query that behaves like a table.

üîπ Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

üîπ Example 1 ‚Äì Simple View
Suppose we have a table called students:

student_id	name	subject	marks	city
1	Anil	Math	78	Pune
2	Bhumika	Science	93	Mumbai
3	Chetan	Math	85	Pune
4	Dhruv	Science	96	Delhi
5	Farah	Math	82	Mumbai
‚úÖ Create a View
CREATE VIEW high_scorers AS
SELECT name, subject, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 85;
‚úÖ Use the View
SELECT * FROM high_scorers;

Result:
name	subject	marks
Bhumika	Science	93
Dhruv	Science	96
üîπ Example 2 ‚Äì View with Aggregation
You can create a view that shows average marks by subject:
CREATE VIEW subject_avg AS
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY subject;

Now you can query the view just like a table:
SELECT * FROM subject_avg;

Result:
subject	avg_marks
Math	81.66
Science	94.5
üîπ Example 3 ‚Äì View with Join
If you have two tables:

students
student_id	name	city
1	Anil	Pune
2	Bhumika	Mumbai

marks
student_id	subject	marks
1	Math	78
2	Science	93

You can create a view combining both:
CREATE VIEW student_marks AS
SELECT s.name, s.city, m.subject, m.marks
FROM students s
JOIN marks m
ON s.student_id = m.student_id;

üîπ View Modification
‚úÖ To update a view:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW high_scorers AS
SELECT name, marks FROM students WHERE marks > 90;

‚úÖ To delete (drop) a view:
DROP VIEW high_scorers;

üß† Key Properties of a View
Property	Description
Virtual Table	Does not store data physically
Based on Query	Stores SQL query, not results
Dynamic	Automatically shows updated data
Can be Queried	Acts like a real table
Read-only or Updatable	Some views allow updates (with conditions)
üß© Advantages of Views

üß± Simplifies Complex Queries
Save long joins or calculations once, reuse them easily.

üîê Security
Restrict access ‚Äî users can see only specific columns via a view.
‚ôªÔ∏è Data Independence
If the base table structure changes, only the view may need updating.
üßæ Reusability
Use the same view in multiple queries or reports.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Views
Limitation	Explanation
Cannot have indexes	Views don‚Äôt store data physically
Some views are read-only	If the view has joins or aggregates
Dependent on base tables	Dropping base tables breaks the view
Performance	Complex views can be slow
üîπ Example 4 ‚Äì Security Use Case

Let‚Äôs say the students table has confidential columns like email and phone.
We can hide them:

CREATE VIEW public_students AS
SELECT name, city, subject
FROM students;

Now users can:
SELECT * FROM public_students;

but can‚Äôt see sensitive info.
üîπ Example 5 ‚Äì Updatable View (If Simple)
If a view is created from a single table without aggregates, you can update it.
CREATE VIEW student_basic AS
SELECT student_id, name, marks FROM students;

You can now do:
UPDATE student_basic
SET marks = 90
WHERE student_id = 1;

This updates the base table (students).
üßæ Summary Table
Feature	Description	Example
Create a view	CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM table;	Creates virtual table
View with filter	CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > 50000;	Filtered data
Replace view	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v2 AS ...	Updates view query
Drop view	DROP VIEW v2;	Deletes the view
Query view	SELECT * FROM v2;	Works like table

Why and When to Use a View
You use a view when you want to make your SQL cleaner, safer, and reusable ‚Äî especially when dealing with complex queries, large systems, or restricted access.

------------------------------ Trigger ----------------------------------------

What is a Trigger in SQL?

A Trigger in SQL is a special stored procedure that automatically executes (fires) in response to certain events on a table or view.

üí° In short:

A trigger is a set of SQL statements that automatically runs when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation occurs on a specified table.

üîπ Types of Triggers
Type	Description
BEFORE Trigger	Executes before the data modification (before insert/update/delete).
AFTER Trigger	Executes after the data modification.
INSTEAD OF Trigger	Used mostly in views, executes instead of the triggering action.
üîπ Trigger Event Operations

A trigger can fire on the following events:

INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

üîπ Syntax of a Trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;

üîπ Example Database Setup

Let‚Äôs create two tables:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE emp_audit (
    audit_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    emp_id INT,
    action VARCHAR(20),
    old_salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    new_salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    action_time DATETIME
);


Now we‚Äôll create triggers for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events.

‚öôÔ∏è 1. INSERT Trigger
‚úÖ Goal:

Whenever a new employee is inserted, record this action in the emp_audit table.

üß† Trigger Code:
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO emp_audit(emp_id, action, new_salary, action_time)
    VALUES (NEW.emp_id, 'INSERT', NEW.salary, NOW());
END;

‚ö° Explanation:

AFTER INSERT ‚Üí Trigger runs after an insert.
NEW ‚Üí Refers to the newly inserted row.
A record is added in emp_audit every time a new employee is added.

üí¨ Example:
INSERT INTO employees(name, salary) VALUES ('Sakshi', 40000);

Result:
emp_id	name	salary
1	Sakshi	40000
audit_id	emp_id	action	old_salary	new_salary	action_time
1	1	INSERT	NULL	40000.00	2025-10-09 20:15:00
‚öôÔ∏è 2. UPDATE Trigger
‚úÖ Goal:

Whenever an employee‚Äôs salary changes, record the old and new salary in the audit table.

üß† Trigger Code:
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_update
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO emp_audit(emp_id, action, old_salary, new_salary, action_time)
    VALUES (OLD.emp_id, 'UPDATE', OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NOW());
END;

‚ö° Explanation:

AFTER UPDATE ‚Üí Trigger runs after an update.
OLD ‚Üí The row‚Äôs data before the update.
NEW ‚Üí The row‚Äôs data after the update.

üí¨ Example:
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 50000
WHERE emp_id = 1;

Result:
emp_id	name	salary
1	Sakshi	50000
audit_id	emp_id	action	old_salary	new_salary	action_time
2	1	UPDATE	40000.00	50000.00	2025-10-09 20:18:00
‚öôÔ∏è 3. DELETE Trigger
‚úÖ Goal:

Whenever an employee is deleted, record the deleted employee details in the audit table.

üß† Trigger Code:
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_delete
AFTER DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO emp_audit(emp_id, action, old_salary, action_time)
    VALUES (OLD.emp_id, 'DELETE', OLD.salary, NOW());
END;

‚ö° Explanation:

AFTER DELETE ‚Üí Trigger runs after a delete.
OLD ‚Üí Refers to the deleted row‚Äôs data.

üí¨ Example:
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 1;

Result:
emp_id	name	salary
(no rows)		
audit_id	emp_id	action	old_salary	new_salary	action_time
3	1	DELETE	50000.00	NULL	2025-10-09 20:20:00
‚öôÔ∏è BEFORE Triggers Example
‚úÖ Goal:

Before inserting a record, ensure salary is not less than 30000.

CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary < 30000 THEN
        SET NEW.salary = 30000;
    END IF;
END;

üí¨ Example:
INSERT INTO employees(name, salary) VALUES ('Rahul', 25000);


üëâ The trigger will automatically set salary = 30000, not 25000.
‚öôÔ∏è INSTEAD OF Trigger (used on Views)

If you have a view that joins multiple tables, you can‚Äôt directly insert or update it.
You can use INSTEAD OF triggers to define what should happen instead.

Example:
CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
SELECT emp_id, name, salary FROM employees;

CREATE TRIGGER instead_of_insert
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON emp_view
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employees(name, salary)
    VALUES (NEW.name, NEW.salary);
END;


Now inserting into the view will actually insert into the employees table.

üîπ Viewing and Dropping Triggers
View existing triggers
SHOW TRIGGERS;

Drop a trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS after_employee_insert;

üìò Summary Table
Operation	Timing	OLD / NEW	Typical Use
BEFORE INSERT	NEW	Validate or modify data before insert	
AFTER INSERT	NEW	Log new inserts	
BEFORE UPDATE	OLD + NEW	Validate or modify updated data	
AFTER UPDATE	OLD + NEW	Track changes	
BEFORE DELETE	OLD	Validate delete	
AFTER DELETE	OLD	Log deleted data	
INSTEAD OF	NEW/OLD	Used in views	
üéØ Real-World Uses of Triggers

‚úÖ Maintaining an audit log
‚úÖ Enforcing business rules (e.g., prevent negative balance)
‚úÖ Auto-updating related tables
‚úÖ Validating data before insert/update
‚úÖ Synchronizing data between tables

Would you like me to make a diagram/table flow showing how the trigger fires and data flows for each operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)?
It helps visualize how OLD and NEW values move between tables.

-----------------------------------------------------Constraints Query ------------------------------------------------------------------
What Are Constraints?

Constraints in SQL are rules applied to table columns to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data in a database.

They prevent invalid data from being entered into the table.

Types of SQL Constraints

Constraint	                                                         Purpose

NOT NULL	                                           Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE	                                               Ensures all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY	                                           Uniquely identifies each row in a table (NOT NULL + UNIQUE)
FOREIGN KEY	                                           Links two tables together
CHECK	                                               Ensures values meet a specific condition
DEFAULT	                                               Sets a default value if no value is provided
AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL) / IDENTITY (SQL Server)	       Automatically generates unique numbers for new rows

1. NOT NULL Constraint
Meaning: Column must have a value (cannot be NULL).
Example:
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  marks INT
);


Here, id and name cannot be left blank when inserting data.
Insert Example:
INSERT INTO students (id, name, marks) VALUES (1, 'Anil', 85);  -- ‚úÖ Works
INSERT INTO students (id, name, marks) VALUES (2, NULL, 90);   -- ‚ùå Error (name cannot be NULL)

üîπ 2. UNIQUE Constraint
Meaning: No two rows can have the same value in this column.
Example:
CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT UNIQUE,
  emp_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);


Each emp_id and email must be unique.
Insert Example:
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Sakshi', 'sakshi@gmail.com');  -- ‚úÖ Works
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, 'Raj', 'sakshi@gmail.com');     -- ‚ùå Error (email duplicate)

üîπ 3. PRIMARY KEY Constraint
Meaning: Uniquely identifies each record (cannot be NULL and must be unique).
Example:

CREATE TABLE students (
  roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  marks INT
);

Insert Example:
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Anil', 78);  -- ‚úÖ
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Bhumika', 93);  -- ‚ùå Duplicate roll_no

üîπ 4. FOREIGN KEY Constraint
Meaning: Creates a link between two tables. The foreign key refers to the primary key of another table.
Example:
CREATE TABLE departments (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(50),
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
);


Insert Example:
INSERT INTO departments VALUES (1, 'HR');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'Sakshi', 1);  -- ‚úÖ Works
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (102, 'Yogesh', 2);  -- ‚ùå Error (dept_id 2 doesn‚Äôt exist)

üîπ 5. CHECK Constraint
Meaning: Ensures that a column‚Äôs value satisfies a condition.

Example:
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  marks INT CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 100)
);


Insert Example:
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Anil', 85);  -- ‚úÖ Works
INSERT INTO students VALUES (2, 'Farah', 150);  -- ‚ùå Error (marks > 100)

üîπ 6. DEFAULT Constraint
Meaning: Assigns a default value if no value is provided.
Example:
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  city VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pune'
);


Insert Example:
INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Anil');  -- city = 'Pune' automatically
üîπ 7. AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL) / IDENTITY (SQL Server)
Meaning: Automatically generates a unique number for each new record.
Example (MySQL):
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  marks INT
);


Insert Example:
INSERT INTO students (name, marks) VALUES ('Anil', 85);
INSERT INTO students (name, marks) VALUES ('Farah', 92);
-- IDs will be automatically 1, 2, etc.

‚úÖ Combine Multiple Constraints
You can use multiple constraints together:

CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  marks INT CHECK (marks BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
  city VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Mumbai'
);
