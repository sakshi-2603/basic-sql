What Are Aggregate Functions?
Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single result (one value).

ðŸ‘‰ For example:
If you have 100 studentsâ€™ marks, and you want to know average marks, youâ€™ll use the aggregate function AVG().

ðŸ”¹ List of Common Aggregate Functions
Function	Description	Example
COUNT()	Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values	COUNT(student_id)
SUM()	Adds up all the values in a column	SUM(marks)
AVG()	Calculates the average of numeric values	AVG(marks)
MIN()	Finds the smallest (minimum) value	MIN(marks)
MAX()	Finds the largest (maximum) value	MAX(marks)
ðŸ§  Important Points

Aggregate functions ignore NULL values (except COUNT(*) which counts all rows).
They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to group data.
They return one value per group or one total value for the entire table.

ðŸ“˜ Example Table: students
student_id	name	marks	subject
1	Anil	78	Math
2	Bhumika	93	Science
3	Chetan	85	Math
4	Dhruv	96	Science
5	Farah	82	Math
ðŸ”¸ 1. COUNT() â€” Count Rows

Purpose: To count total number of records.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;

ðŸ‘‰ Output:
total_students
---------------
5

Count only specific column values (non-null):
SELECT COUNT(marks) FROM students;
ðŸ”¸ 2. SUM() â€” Add Values
Purpose: To find total sum of numeric column.

SELECT SUM(marks) AS total_marks
FROM students;


ðŸ‘‰ Output:

total_marks
------------
434

ðŸ”¸ 3. AVG() â€” Find Average
Purpose: To find the average marks.
SELECT AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students;

ðŸ‘‰ Output:
average_marks
--------------
86.8

ðŸ”¸ 4. MIN() â€” Find Minimum
Purpose: To find the lowest marks.
SELECT MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks
FROM students;

ðŸ‘‰ Output:
lowest_marks
--------------
78

ðŸ”¸ 5. MAX() â€” Find Maximum
Purpose: To find the highest marks.
SELECT MAX(marks) AS highest_marks
FROM students;

ðŸ‘‰ Output:
highest_marks
---------------
96

ðŸ”¸ 6. GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
If you want to apply functions for each subject:
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY subject;


ðŸ‘‰ Output:
subject   | avg_marks
-----------|------------
Math       | 81.66
Science    | 94.5

ðŸ”¸ 7. Using HAVING with Aggregate Functions
You cannot use WHERE with aggregate results â€” use HAVING instead.

Example:
Show only subjects where average marks > 85:
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY subject
HAVING AVG(marks) > 85;

ðŸ‘‰ Output:
subject  | avg_marks
----------|------------
Science  | 94.5

ðŸ§© Summary Table
Function	Meaning	Example
COUNT()	Number of rows	COUNT(*)
SUM()	Total of values	SUM(marks)
AVG()	Average value	AVG(marks)
MIN()	Minimum value	MIN(marks)
MAX()	Maximum value	MAX(marks)
